# GridGame
A TypeScript class that makes it easy to create grid based games.

GridGame is a TypeScript helper class that creates a playing field.  
It needs to know the amount of tiles you want horizontally and vertically.  
It also supports a function that it can call that will set custom information that the game needs per tile.  
For example a click counter or a secret that lies beneath the tile.  
For Minesweeper the secret would be the kind of the tile: Is it a bomb or not.  
 
GridGame contains the following helper methods:
